# ECE_143_project
## Team 19: Harker Russell, Jake Kim, Pratyush Dwivedi, Ruihao Wei

### File Structure
1. **Source_Code**
 - `project_functions.py`: All custom functions are located in this file, and imported from this file for use in scripts.  
 - `box_and_whisker.py`: Script that generates box and whisker plots.  
 - `word_clouds.py`: Script that generates word clouds as presented.  
 - `radial_column.py`: Script that generates radial column chart as presented.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 - `Data_Job_NY.csv`: New York state'raw' csv file of data scraped from glassdoor--needed to run scripts.  
 - `Data_Job_SF.csv`: San Francisco area 'raw' csv file of data scraped from glassdoor--needed to run scripts.  
 - `Data_Job_TX.csv`: Texas 'raw' csv file of data scraped from glassdoor--needed to run scripts.  
 - `Data_Job_WA.csv`: Washington state 'raw' csv file of data scraped from glassdoor--needed to run scripts.  
 - `archive`: Folder for depricated code
 - `__pycache__`  
 - **note** each chart/plot has it's own script e.g. box and whisker plots are generated by running the code `box_and_whisker.py`.  
2. **Plots**
 - contains all generated plots as .png files for easy access.  
3. `project_plots.ipynb`: jupyter notebook which shows all the visualizations generated for the Team 19 presentation.  
4. `READMO.md`: Read me file outlining file structure, instructions to run code and required third-party libraries and modules



### How to run code
1. Ensure all required third party modules (listed below) are installed.
2. Ensure all files located in *Source Code* folder are kept in the same directory (including job data csv files)
3. Run script files to see generate plots 

### Required Third Party Libraries and Modules
1. **Seaborn** 
 - `conda install seaborn`
 - `pip install seaborn`
