10,Supply Chain Data Scientist (GS 13 Equivalent),"Credence Management Solutions, LLC",DC,Washington,67991,98323,"The U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is the US Government’s (USG) flagship global malaria initiative led by USAID and implemented together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Initiative is results-based, focused, and exhibits a high level of financial and programmatic accountability. In 2015, PMI launched the next six-year strategy, setting forth a new bold vision, and an ambitious goal with specific objectives. The PMI Strategy for 2015-2020 takes into account the progress over the past decade and the new challenges that have arisen, and reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity working towards the long term vision of a world free of malaria. The Bureau for Global Health (GH) serves as the Agency’s primary source of intellectual capital, technical leadership, and donor coordination for the health sector. GH is vested with the responsibility for advancing field-relevant, state-of-the-art research and the transfer of new technologies and approaches to field programs and in technically and programmatically supporting USAID Mission health program implementation in the field. The Office of Infectious Disease (ID) is one of GH’s eight offices. The Malaria Division is one of four divisions of the ID Office. Leadership, management, and oversight of PMI are carried out from the Malaria Division under the leadership of the US Global Malaria Coordinator as are management of USAID’s malaria research investments (most notably vaccine, drug, and insecticide research programs) and USAID’s global partner engagement including WHO and RBM Partnership to End Malaria.  To succeed in eliminating malaria, countries and their partners need to deploy the right resources at the right place and at the right time. By getting better, more accurate insights from existing data and accelerating the data-to-action cycle, countries and their partners can better respond to changes in on-the-ground conditions. That is why, in 2018, PMI began a major transformation towards greater use of data to inform decisions on resource allocation. As part of this new effort, PMI launched a new quarterly reporting process to ensure operational decision-making is based on timely and granular malaria data. In addition, at the headquarters level, PMI is developing a web-based data platform (“PMI Data Lake”) with analytics tools that will facilitate the triangulation and use of relevant datasets, including visualizations of epidemiological, supply chain, entomological, demographic, programmatic, and financial data. In addition to the quarterly reporting data, the PMI Data Lake will house other supply chain data including PMI order and shipment data and procurement planning and monitoring report data. In 2019, PMI entered a data sharing agreement with The Global Fund (GF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) that included supply chain data. This agreement provides the foundation to bring our various supply chain data together to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our supply chain program. Key responsibilities include: providing guidance, monitoring, and technical support related to SC data needs to USAID at headquarters, and in the field with USAID Missions, PMI country teams, technical counterparts, implementing partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies. S/he will exercise independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines. The Data Scientist will receive day to day guidance from the Malaria Division Supply Chain Branch Chief. Job RequirementsThe Data Scientist is a key member of the Malaria Division’s SC Branch team. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic expertise to PMI’s SC efforts to support PMI’s increased focus on enhancing data-driven decision-making internally and externally within focus countries. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic guidance and support to strengthen and guide SC data collection, reporting and integration and implementation of data management platforms across PMI focus countries. The Data Scientist will support the work of PMI staff at USAID headquarters and in PMI countries. The Data Scientist will work in collaboration with global malaria stakeholders and technical partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies to provide technical leadership with a focus on SC data and integration of data systems, strategic information management and data visualization. S/he will exercise professional judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines.Technical AssistanceServe as a technical and programmatic resource for PMI’s supply chain team, particularly focused on data related topics.Organize, compile, query and analyze programmatic and technical data related to supply chain (e.g., inventory levels throughout the supply chain, consumption/demand, supply plans, orders and shipments, etc.) from disparate sources and in different formats to improve PMI’s ability to use data to drive supply chain-related decisions, and organize/analyze/present data for use in briefings, publications, and reports.Carry out quantitative analyses and triangulation of data from a variety of sources (e.g. financial, programmatic, epidemiological, entomological, supply chain, demographic) to unearth implementation obstacles and opportunities.

JGI & Berkeley Lab: A View to Fuel Innovative Science in the Public Interest

They say it’s all about location and Berkeley Lab has it all: a view above the San Francisco Bay, cool breezes, and world-class multidisciplinary science within a diverse and respectful research ecosystem of 5,000 people. Nearly 90 years ago, Ernest Orlando Lawrence, the inventor of the cyclotron, brought physicists, biologists, engineers and mathematicians together in Berkeley above the University of California campus to tackle the most urgent scientific challenges. Today, after garnering 13 Nobel Prizes, Berkeley Lab has sustained and grown that tradition of open, interdisciplinary team science, exemplified by how the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) addresses the most pressing energy and environmental challenges using integrative genome science approaches. JGI takes up residence in the new, state-of-the-art Integrative Genomics Building (IGB) along with the U.S. Department of Energy Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase) to expand the frontiers of energy and environmental science in partnership with the worldwide community of researchers. Will you join us and be a critical part of our next ground-breaking discoveries?
