47,Senior Data Engineer,Afresh Technologies,CA,San Francisco,124778,161987,"At Afresh, we’re solving the big problems around food waste and the fresh food supply chain--focusing first in grocery. We use cutting-edge AI (we’ve been published in ICML!) combined with thoughtful design to enhance decision-making and optimize store workflows. The results are powerful: in live deployments in grocery stores, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+!What will you be doing?


Building fast and reliable data pipelines that enable training machine learning models over billions of historical data points collected from tens of thousands of retail stores across the US.Integrating with our customers’ infrastructure, which includes a variety of contemporary and legacy IT systems. Setting up data feeds from the customers’ systems.Maintaining transactional, analytic, and NoSQL databases and data lakes over terabytes of data.Collaborating with an interdisciplinary team of experts in machine learning, data scientists, design, software engineering, and business process optimization


What skills and experience do you need?


Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science or equivalent.2+ years of work experience.Strong programming and problem-solving skills.Expert-level knowledge of databases, data lakes, data pipelines, SQL. Experience with big data frameworks such as Apache Spark is a big plus.Experience working with Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and other cloud providers.Familiarity with statistical concepts and/or devops expertise are a plus. Experience with data visualization is a plus.


Background
About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.
Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.
Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the nuances of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in Fresh categories -- produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit. 
So far, the results are awesome! Like we said above, in live deployments, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+.
We're growing fast: we're in partnership with 4 large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

In this role you'll be a member of the Scalable Infrastructure team which is part of the Algorithms Platform. This team provides frameworks and services to access and operate on our data, including Spark, Presto, and custom tools. This team also handles initial data ingestion: our data initially comes from our Kafka logging pipeline along with regular snapshots of transactional databases. Our ETL framework along with tools to track and monitor jobs helps to increase reliability while making it easier for data scientists to obtain and manipulate data.

About the role

In this role you'll be contributing heavily to our Spark infrastructure, creating and improving services to make it easier for the team to submit and monitor jobs and providing established patterns for data scientists to create their jobs. Occasionally you'll help a team member design or debug a more complex Spark job or perhaps a pipeline of multiple jobs. The interesting thing you'll find about our department is the diversity of applications we support, the varied sizes of our jobs, and the different ways that we use Spark. This role will be exciting for you if you enjoy building and monitoring infrastructure along with digging into complex tools and making them easier for others to use.

Some typical projects you might work on include (but aren't limited to!):



You'll help us improve our Spark, Presto, and custom service deployments to function well under load and in AWS. You'll extend these services and create new ones to help make the experience better for our data scientists.
We build our own versions of Spark along with custom libraries included in each Spark job, so you will contribute to our Spark/Presto customization efforts, builds, and deployments.
You'll help us utilize various file formats (e.g. Parquet), and help create readers and writers that function well on S3 and with our metadata services.
You'll build services to ingest data into our warehouse and ensure it's clean and consistent.
Many of the changes we need would also benefit others in the big data community. You'll have the opportunity to contribute back.


We get excited about candidates who have:



5+ years of software development experience with significant contributions.
Exceptional coding and design skills, particularly in Java/Scala.
Strong distributed systems background, and have worked with Spark and other tools in the Hadoop ecosystem.
Ability to work autonomously and take ownership of projects.
Understanding of how big data infrastructure works in the public cloud.
Natural curiosity and tendency to get excited to dig in and understand how things work.
