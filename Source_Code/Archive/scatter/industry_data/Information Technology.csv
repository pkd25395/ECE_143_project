About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:


Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.

Required Skills / Experiences

Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.

Desired Skills / Experiences

2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Types of projects you'll be working on:

Text Analysis and Entity Recognition

We send thousands of documents and ingest thousands more from external sources. This data is messy, sometimes unstructured, and we need to be smarter about how we correlate company entities. How can we tell if two companies with similar names are the same or different?
We are collecting thousands of reviews from our users to capture feedback on different contractors on things like payment timeliness, communication practices, etc How can we summarize the overall sentiment of reviews for a specific contractor and what are the common pros / cons?

How can we rate the payment risk of a contractor and share that information with users in a helpful, digestible way?A large commercial construction project can last many years and include hundreds of contractors. Or a single address can have multiple projects over the years with different contractors. Or a property, like an office building, can have different distinct projects going on at one time. How can we tell the difference?Data Modeling and Heuristics A user is on a project that we know other subcontractors are experiencing slow payment on. What other documents should we recommend the user do to ensure they get paid?Most of the construction industry is based on working relationships and prior work history. What relationships and other parties can we infer that are working on the project based on the existing connections from other projects we see in our graph?

Project Athenian: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever.

325,Senior Software Engineer - Revenue Data Platform (Revenue Platform),Twitter,CA,San Francisco,161055,180140,"
Who We Are:

Revenue data has the largest data challenges in all of Twitter. We are making the Terabytes of data we collect every day along with its history fully queryable and searchable in seconds. Advertisers, data scientists and engineers need that data to be broken down by market segments and user attributes that cover as many as 50 dimensions. To make that data easier to generate, store and query we’re building a next generation analytics framework that will power all Revenue data and eventually do the same for Twitter broadly. We seek to make answering questions at Twitter as easy as asking them. Our team is pioneering new technologies at Twitter and was the first to run production services in Google Cloud. By using cloud technologies to solve problems we've learned that we can offload pager and infrastructure maintenance to Google and focus all of our time on solving the large problems that Twitter faces. Given the enormity of the task we face, we need your help to design and implement the tools and services that will make it easy for Twitter to make data driven decisions.

If you have a philosophy of building the tools that solve a broad set of problems, this is the team for you. If you have a relentless customer focus that will help us to accelerate developer and analytic productivity, this is the team for you.

What You'll Do:Rather than speak in generalities, here is a sampling of what we’ve been building:

Large Data Collider (LDC) - Analytics query server with a pluggable backend that gives customers a consistent query interface. By providing consistency at query time, we can swap out backends like Bigtable and Druid to meet the latency or data model requirements of customers.Big Executor - BigQuery and DataFlow Job executor that lets users define their data flows using SQL, opening up data pipeline creation to non-engineers.SuperConductor - General Purpose data loading system that loads well defined data into pluggable backends for querying by LDC. Supports streaming and batch inserts as well as streaming data compression. Automatic Alerting - Will allow users to select the metrics that are important to them and uses models to highlight data outliers so users will be notified of any unexpected product behavior early.

Current/Upcoming projects:Twitter has broadly recognized the platform as where Twitter as a whole wants to go for data analytics. To that end, we need you to help us expand the platform to serve an ever broader set of use cases.

Data Aggregator - Beam based, configuration driven aggregator that let’s users define their Aggregations and dimensions that can run against batch and streaming data sets. Allows users to define their aggregations without redeployment.LDC Views - Build the ability to define custom views on the queries. Will allow users to define business logic and ensure consistent views on data regardless of backend.

What Else You Can Expect:We believe that people are our strongest asset, and take special interest in each and every one of our engineers. You can expect a real investment in your professional growth, and a dedication to crafting a strong, sustainable career for you. Our teams are composed of highly talented and passionate 'A' players, and you’ll get the mentorship and coaching you deserve to hone your skills and expertise. Our vibrant culture and high expectations will kindle your passion and bring out the best in you!

In particular, we are an experienced team of senior engineers that work across batch, streaming, and serving systems to deliver solutions to a diverse set of problems here at Twitter. We move quickly and we expect to make an impact. If this describes your approach to writing software, apply to join us!

Who You Are:

Industry experience working in a distributed computing environment.A strong passion for building tools and systems that enable other developers on your team to build great things.Proven strengths in algorithms, complex data structures, and dynamic programming.Previous experience with cloud server environments such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and/or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).An understanding of continuous integration and a strong drive toward automation.Well versed in multi-threading, scaling, concurrency, caching, queuing, RPC, and distributed data storage.Ability to thrive in a dynamic, fast-paced, and collaborative environment.Strong attention to detail.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.
