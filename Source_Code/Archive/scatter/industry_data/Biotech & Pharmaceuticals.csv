More About UsNotable Labs is a precision medicine company that has a translational drug discovery platform focused on identifying novel therapeutic options for cancer patients.

Our clinical research lab helps oncologists identify personalized and rational combinations of treatments for patients. We've developed a high throughput robotic flow cytometry lab platform that screens thousands of FDA-approved and investigational drug combinations against the patient's own cancer cells to help predict safer and more effective cancer treatments. Our lab has completed initial feasibility studies with clinicians in relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia & Myelodysplastic Syndrome, with an 84% predictive rate. Focusing on individual patients and existing treatments, we're working to discover novel uses of drugs and defining mechanisms underlying cancer progression and drug resistance.

Our research and development platform extends our clinical research to drug discovery, testing novel compounds with primary patient samples for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Using our automated, high-throughput, multi-parametric drug screening research platform, industry partners can assay the biological impact of novel compounds on primary cells in a physiologically relevant environment. This helps our partners stratify patients by their predicted responsiveness, increasing the probability of successful clinical development. We are actively partnering with pharmaceutical companies that have preclinical and clinical stage drug pipelines in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or related hematological malignancies to profile experimental drug activity in patient samples.
