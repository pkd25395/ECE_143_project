Today, our team counts over 40 data scientists, engineers, and strategists from diverse backgrounds who share a passion for using data to solve the world’s greatest social and analytical challenges. We’ve served more than 400 organizations ranging from political campaigns to advocacy groups, unions, government agencies, and international groups, as well as companies in the automotive, travel, consumer packaged goods, entertainment, healthcare, media, telecom, and other industries.

You’re not afraid of messy data --and yet you also pull the emergency stop when something looks or feels wrong.

We’re not building a team for a day—this is a project for the long haul. More than anything else, we’re looking for people who are excited by our mission, love to create, are honest about what they know, fascinated by what they don’t, and relish the opportunity to work with people who value the same.

In this position you will:

Develop repeatable data transformations, integrating data from dozens of disparate data sources, to create a clear, unified view of 62+ million Medicare beneficiaries.
Analyze healthcare claims datasets to find novel insights -- and then communicate those in a way that moves the needle on people’s health outcomes.
Analyze data about how individuals use digital tools in order to make services more intuitive and engaging, and the outreach around them more relevant and effective.
Check, clean and transform incoming data for data pipelines and outreach (email, SMS, etc) campaigns.
Collaborate with engineers, data scientists, program managers and external stakeholders to troubleshoot problems and proactively create solutions.
Strive to support team excellence by developing high quality documentation.
Work both independently and as part of a team to deliver accurate products on short deadlines.

You probably have:

Proficient understanding of how to manipulate data with SQL.
Experience creating complex, repeatable data pipelines that operate on millions or billions of records
Proficiency in one or more general or statistical programming languages such as Python, Ruby or R – and/or interest learning new ones.
Experience going from insight to impact: Using the results of your analysis to tell a story through visualization, presentation, and writing.
2+ years of work experience working with data about people.

You may have:

Experience working with healthcare data -- claims or EHR data.
Experience working on a high volume, targeted outreach campaign in government, e-commerce, consumer finance, a political campaign or similar organization.
An undergraduate degree in a quantitative field or equivalent technical training.
Experience creating informative and engaging data visualizations.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences. Mature, humble, and genuine, SEI Consultants frequently go above and beyond for both their clients and their colleagues. SEI Consultants are ethical and trustworthy individuals who do what they say. SEI Consultants have an insatiable curiosity and love to learn. These individuals are commonly tech savvy and early adopters. Their passion for learning is infectious and excites others.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.
